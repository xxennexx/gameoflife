# Game of Life
Yet another Game of Life implementation, this time in Next.js.

The component supports 3 modes (sizes):
- fixed (set size)
- autodetect (automatically calculate the optimal size for the grid)
- infinite (WIP, most likely won't ever be fully implemented due to severe memory usage, even with smaller sizes)

## Preview

## TODOs
- Infinite mode (will probably require some optimization)
- Center auto-sized grid
